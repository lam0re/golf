# Golf
This two tasks were created for the Hack.lu CTF 2015.

## Story
Johnny B. Krad from your local schoolyard gang thinks that you are a poser! The stuff you solved until now was just luck. He bets that you are not able to beat him in Perl golf.

## Warning
At the moment the web server user has to be in the dockers group. That's not good, so I recommend to run it in a virtual machine.
